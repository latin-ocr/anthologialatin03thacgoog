the honoured nmesof Conington and Kennedy, of
Mum-o and Ellis, of Paley and of Meyer3 but the
editor glwdly takes the opportunity, not merely of
unknowledging the many obligations under which
he lies individually to their commentarios, but still
more of expressin'g how deeply the cause of Latin
scholarship is indebted to their labours during the
last quarter of a century.

The apparent duration of genuine Latin pueny,
as represented by the interval of more than 700
years that septu-ates Naevius from Boethius, must
not mislead us· In reality its death-lmen had
sounded in the third century, when quantity,
although the knowledge of it was retained by
artificial training, had already begu'n to be super-
seded by accent. Stin allowing, as we must, for
the display of the highest poetic genius in Italy, a
brief period as compared with that of its manifes-
tation in Greece3 allowing‚ too, the want of crea-
tive power and originality which charaeta-{aes much
of the poeti-y of the Romans, we ,must still claim
for it that it is their ‘ most complete literary monu-
ment! Apart from the national character which
is indelibly stamped upon them, there is a. tender-
ness and a brilliancy, a dignity and a strength in
the masterpieces of the Roman poets, which en·
title them to rank among the lasting treasures be·

queathed to us by the past.
