At a time when the requirements of education
are being daily extended, ἰι may be a help to
studente who cannot read through many entire
authors (however desirable that may be) to have
some survey like the present of one branch of
ancient literature. At a time too of which it has
been remex-hed, that om· sensibilities to grace and
beauty have not kept paee with our scientifie pro-
gress, and which is sometimes indifferent to literary
form, it may be well to have the attention reoelled
ω a few excellent models, many of which. it is
believed, if committed to memory, will prove a.
source of life-long pleasure, and grew dearer by
familiarity with all the oteadfanmees of an old and
well-tried friendship.
