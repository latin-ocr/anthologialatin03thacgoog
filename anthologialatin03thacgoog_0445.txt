NOTES. 4¹3

In the first plne, they devoted great aad not wholly
uelem paine to description and :hnilesz a subject which,
when loffier abjecta were poeeooeupied or proscribed by the
evil days on which they had fiuen, opened ont a wide field
ιο nient of the second rank.

Accordingly they are much indebted to pointing, especially
when they have to describe conati-ie· οι· ωειιετγ, md the
muse sn uthis branchos the nrt seemsnot tohave been
demovet! before the August-‚n age. In this nik of poeti-y.

pei-bapt more true tumtum than someevenorthegrent
postu ‘though we must admit that they too often indulge
in minute delineation, and annot bring themselves to give
the ml touch to their picture.

In the next place, these writers evinco no ordinary taste

tiens. Exempla of this abeund in the silvae of Statius.
written, aa they tre, in slight ond easy style, the subject
being suggested by the mtnee, the country homes, the
hatho, or the somnes urhis mendo, they are oteeped in u
nost aad menow light, and invented with a eham: peculinrly
their own. Statius, indeed, risen at times to a higher ssight.
as in that lovely ⁸ Epioedium in Glauciam: in which he offer·

In satire, in spite of his general harabum, Persiu· ocea-
nionally approaches his master, Horace. In Martini, whose
witty epigrama seem armed with atinga, we see the utmoot
degree of terseneoe and snbtlety of which the Latin lengmge
was capable. But we must look for a masculine md
genuinely Roman atteranoe to Juvenal. the last of the
really ltaxian poeta, and nne nnequalled sor his power of
waning indignation at evil.
